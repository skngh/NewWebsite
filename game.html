                Hello! My name is Sam Knight, I’m a 21 year old game developer and sound designer from Maine. I’m currently studying Electronic Production & Design, with a minor in Creative Coding at Berklee College of Music. Most of my focus at Berklee has been on game development and audio programming, where my main interests lie. I love creating things for others to use and enjoy, such as video games or software instruments. I have participated in multiple game jams, both in a team as the sound designer/implementer, or as a solo developer. In my free time, I’m either making music of my own or building devices that help me get weirder sounds. You can check out my demo reel on the left if you’re interested in seeing more.
